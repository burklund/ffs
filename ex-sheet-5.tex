\maketitle

In class we have been discussing synthetic stems.
The ext ring $\Ext_{\A}^{**}(\F_2,\F_2) \cong \pi_{**}C\tau$ has been determined in a large range through computer calculations.
See \href{http://www.rrb.wayne.edu/papers/index.html}{Bob Bruner's webpage} and particularly ``40. The cohomology of the mod 2 Steenrod Algebra'' for this data.
For an Adams $E_2$-chart see the link to the charts prepared by Isaksen, Wang, Xu
in the discord.

\begin{itemize}
\item Determine as many $\F_2$-synthetic stems as you can (and through this the classical stems as well).
\end{itemize}

Pay attention to extension problems, multiplicative structure, and Toda brackets.
Use any of the techniques we've developed in class.
Use as much outside knowledge as you want.
To avoid getting stuck, I would encourage you to work non-linearly (often hard differentials / extensions have many consequences and thinking about those consequences can sometimes lead to a proof).
