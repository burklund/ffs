\section*{\bf Background}

The first $13$ stable homotopy groups of the $2$-local sphere $\Ss_{(2)}$ can be computed using only the Serre spectral sequence. 
These groups (and the ring structure) are given in the table below:

\section{\bf Exercise 1: The homotopy of $\KO$ (hfp approach)}

$\mathrm{KO}$ is an $\E_\infty$-algebra in $\Sp$ whose associated cohomology theory
classifies stable vector bundles.
Similarly, $\mathrm{KU}$ is an $\E_\infty$-algebra in $\Sp$ whose associated cohomology theory
classifies stable complex vector bundles.
Complexification of vector bundles induces a map of $\E_{\infty}$-algebras
$\KO \to \KU,$
furthermore complex conjugation provides a $C_2$-action on $\KU$ such that
$\KO \cong \KU^{hC_2}$.

The $C_2$ action on $\KU$ by complex conjugation
sends the generator $\beta$ in $\pi_2\KU$ to $-\beta$.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(0 (bonus))] Using your understanding of complex vector bundles prove that
  complex conjugatin acts by $-1$ on $\pi_2\KU$.
\item[(a)] Determine the $E_2$-page of the $C_2$-homotopy fixed point sseq which has signature
  \[ E_2^{s,t} \Rightarrow \pi_{t-s}(\KU^{hC_2}). \]
\end{itemize}

In order to proceed we will need one more piece of information:
The image of the class $\eta \in \pi_1\Ss$ in $\pi_1\KO$ is non-zero and
moreover this class is detected in the $C_2$-hfp sseq in $E_\infty^{1,2}$.
With this information in hand we will now investigate the $C_2$-homotopy fixed point sseq.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(b)] Determine the differentials in the $C_2$-hfp sseq for $\KU^{hC_2}$.
\item[(c)] Determine the ring of homotopy groups $\pi_*\KO$.
\item[(d)] Determine the bigraded homotopy ring of the filtered ring spectrum
  $(\tau_{\geq \bullet} \KU)^{hC_2}$ underlying the $C_2$-hfp sseq.
\end{itemize}

\section{\bf Exercise 5: Slicing sseqs}

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] Determine the homotopy groups of $\ku^{hC_2}$ where the action is by complex conjugation (recall that $\ku$ is the connective cover of $\KU$). Observe that $\ku^{hC_2}$ is not $\ko$.
\end{itemize}

In the remainder of this exercise we will explore the idea of ``slicing'' spectral sequences.
Let $\left( {}^aE_r^{s,t}, d_r \right)$ and $\left( {}^bE_r^{s,t}, d_r \right)$
be a pair of sseqs and suppose we have a  map
\[ \left( {}^AE_r^{s,t}, d_r \right) \to \left( {}^BE_r^{s,t}, d_r \right) \]
between them.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(b)] Let $(m,c)$ be.
  Suppose that the map of $E_2$-pages is an isomorphism
  for $s \geq m(t-s) + c$ and
  ${}^A E_2^{s,t} = 0$ for $s < m(t-s) + c$.
  For which $(m,c)$ can the differentials in the $A$-sseq be deduced from the
  differentials in the $B$-sseq.
\item[(c)] Under the hypotheses of (b)
  with $(m=-1,c=0)$ give a formula for ${}^AE_\infty^{s,t}$ in terms of the $B$-sseq.
\item[(d)] Let $X$ be a spectrum with a $G$-action, taking connective covers we
  obtain a $G$-action on $\tau_{\geq 0}X$ and a $G$-equivariant map $\tau_{\geq 0}X \to X$.
  Show that the associated map of $G$-homotopy fixed point sseqs
  is an instance of slicing.
\end{itemize}

Now we'll think about the dual situation.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(e)] Let $(m,c)$ be.
  Suppose that the map of $E_2$-pages is an isomorphism
  for $s \leq m(t-s) + c$ and
  ${}^B E_2^{s,t} = 0$ for $s > m(t-s) + c$.
  For which $(m,c)$ can the differentials in the $B$-sseq be deduced from the
  differentials in the $A$-sseq.
\item[(f)] Under the hypotheses of (d)
  with $(m=-1,c=0)$ give a formula for ${}^AE_\infty^{s,t}$ in terms of the $B$-sseq.  
\item[(g)] Let $X_\bullet$ be a spectrum with a skeletal filtration.
  Let $(X_k)_{\bullet}$ be the $k$-skeleton of $X$ with its restricted skeletal filtation.
  Show that the map of skeletal sseqs associated to $(X_k)_\bullet \to X_\bullet$
  is an instance of slicing.      
\end{itemize}
  
Think about some scenarios where a sseq might be sliced multiple times.


\section{\bf Exercise 6: A bracket in $\KO$}

In this exercise we will recover an instance of Moss' theorem on
the interaction between Toda brackets and sseqs.

Prove that in $\pi_*\KO$ we have
\[ \langle 2, \eta, \eta^2 \rangle = \alpha + 2\blacksquare \]
where $\alpha$ is a generator of $\pi_4\KO$.

\section{\bf Exercise 7: The Wood cofiber sequence (ver 2)}

$\mathrm{KO}$ is an $\E_\infty$-algebra in $\Sp$ whose associated cohomology theory
classifies stable vector bundles.
Complexification gives a map of $\E_\infty$-algebras
\[ \KO \to \KU. \]

homotopy groups of both

(a) determine what the map does on homotopy.


(b) Reduce computing cof eta homotopy to a single bracket.



(c)

The ring spectrum $\mathrm{KU}$ satisfies the following properties
